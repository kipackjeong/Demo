    "I understand you're asking about the AI Agent Framework. This system provides a comprehensive solution for building conversational AI applications with real-time streaming capabilities. The framework is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing you to integrate various AI services and tools.",
    
    "The framework includes several key components: WebSocket communication for real-time messaging, LangGraph for complex agent workflows, and Qdrant integration for vector-based retrieval. This architecture enables sophisticated AI interactions with context awareness and memory.",
    
    "You can extend this framework with custom agents, tools, and integrations. The modular architecture makes it easy to add new capabilities as your needs evolve. For example, you could integrate code execution, web browsing, or database queries as agent tools.",
    
    "The streaming architecture ensures responses feel natural and responsive, with tokens appearing as they're generated rather than waiting for complete responses. This creates a more engaging user experience and allows for real-time interaction patterns.",
    
    "The framework supports multi-agent orchestration, allowing you to create complex workflows where different AI agents collaborate to solve problems. This is particularly useful for tasks that require different types of expertise or processing steps.",
    
    "Session management is built into the framework, providing conversation persistence and context tracking. This enables the AI to maintain coherent conversations across multiple interactions and remember important details from previous exchanges.",
    
    "The backend is built with FastAPI and includes comprehensive error handling, rate limiting, and security features. The frontend uses React with TypeScript for a robust and maintainable user interface.",
    
    "Future enhancements could include integration with various LLM providers, custom tool development, voice interaction capabilities, and advanced analytics for conversation insights."
