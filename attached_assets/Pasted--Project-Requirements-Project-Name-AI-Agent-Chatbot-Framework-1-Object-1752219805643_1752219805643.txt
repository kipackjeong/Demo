# **📄 Project Requirements **

**Project Name**: AI Agent Chatbot Framework

---

## **1. 🎯 Objective**

Establish a modular, production-ready chatbot architecture that enables **bidirectional**, **streaming** communication between a React-based frontend and an AI agent system powered by **AutoGen** on a FastAPI backend.

This project is intended as a **framework only**, with no business context or application-specific logic at this stage.

## **2. 🧱 System Architecture Overview**

### **🔀 High-Level Architecture**

```
User (React App)
   ⇅ WebSocket
Backend (FastAPI)
   ⇅ AutoGen Agents
```

### **Components:**

| **Component** | **Tech Stack** | **Role** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | React + TypeScript | UI/UX, sends and receives chat messages via WebSocket |
| Backend API | FastAPI + WebSocket | Handles real-time messaging and orchestrates agent responses |
| Agent Runtime | AutoGen (Python) | Manages intelligent multi-agent conversations |
| Deployment | Docker (optional) | Dev/staging environments, scalability |

---

## **3. ⚙️ Functional Requirements**

### **3.1 Frontend (React)**

- Render a simple chat interface (user input + streamed response area)
- Establish WebSocket connection on user action
- Display messages in a streaming fashion (append as tokens arrive)
- Handle connection failures and retries gracefully
- Allow bidirectional turn-taking

### **3.2 Backend (FastAPI)**

- WebSocket endpoint: /ws/chat
- Accept incoming user messages and route them to AutoGen agent logic
- Stream agent replies back to frontend over WebSocket
- Handle agent-to-user negotiation (e.g., ask for clarification mid-task)
- Support session/state tracking (stubbed for now)

### **3.3 Agent Layer (AutoGen)**

- Setup AutoGen UserProxyAgent and AssistantAgent instances
- Allow injection of user messages as external inputs to the proxy agent
- Yield response tokens or text incrementally for WebSocket streaming
- Modular design to support future RAG/tool use

## **4. 🧪 Non-Functional Requirements**

| **Category** | **Requirement** |
| --- | --- |
| **Scalability** | Must support multiple concurrent chat sessions |
| **Performance** | First token response within 1s (mocked), full response under 5s |
| **Maintainability** | Clean codebase with modular backend folders: agents/, routes/, core/ |
| **Security** | WebSocket should be behind HTTPS in production; no secrets exposed to frontend |
| **Testability** | Include unit test stubs for WebSocket routes and agent handlers |
